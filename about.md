# About Me

Hi, I’m Ben — and the non-exhaustive list of self-identifiers includes:

- **Data scientist**
- Finance bro (by education)
- Car enthusiast (Papaya 2025, M440i)
- Math enjoyer & LaTeX advocate
- Wine drinker & AI optimist
- Yoga do-er & strategic thinker
- Closeted (or not so closeted) nerd
- Bayesian modeling dabbler
- Python programmer (by necessity)
- R programmer (by preference)
- Book reader, knowledge hoarder, probably overthinking something right now

This site is my home base for sharing projects, writing about things that fascinate me, and building public credibility — part portfolio, part lab notebook, part personal sandbox.

## Credentials, Experience, and Other Justifications for Listening to Me

- **Masters in Finance & Risk Management**  
- **Masters in Economics & Econometrics**  
- **"Investment Analyst" at a Fortune 200 company**  
   > *Misleading title — it's really half finance, half data science, with a marketing flavor*  
- **Statistical researcher and consultant**, helping others wrangle their data and math into publishable form
- **Recovering systems administrator** (yes, I still write bash scripts)

## What I Actually Do

My work lives at the intersection of **data science, finance, and strategy**, where I use quantitative and computational methods to find structure in messy, intricate datasets.

I specialize in:
- **Causal inference**  
- **Machine learning** (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Symbolic Regression, etc.)  
- **Bayesian and frequentist statistical modeling**  
- **Marketing measurement and MMM**  
- Telling compelling stories from complex models

In short: I like solving hard problems with data, and I try to stay on the steep part of the learning curve. Lately I’ve been reading [*Bayesian Data Analysis*](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/book/) — it’s as good as everyone says.
