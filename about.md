# About Me

### Hi, I’m Ben — and my non-exhaustive list of self-identifiers includes:

- **Data scientist**, because it's the easiest shorthand
- Finance-fluent, with a bias toward rigor and realism
- Physics enthusiast (what *is* a spinor?)
- Casual car guy (Papaya 2025, M440i, daily smirk)
- Data deliberator and structured thinker (in matrix, dataframe, database, or spreadsheet)
- Math enjoyer, LaTeX loyalist, and fan of clean derivations
- Wine drinker, caffeine-fiend, and occasional techno philosopher (usually in conjunction with one of the former)
- Yoga do-er, sometimes for balance, often for sanity 
- Nerd (closeted and celebrated)
- Bayesian modeling dabbler — priors welcome
- Python programmer (out of necessity and joy)
- R programmer (out of joy)
- Book reader, knowledge hoarder, and probably overthinking something right now
- Also: pro forma builder, modeling maximalist, and finder of false tradeoffs

### This site is my home base for sharing projects, writing about things that fascinate me, and building public credibility — part portfolio, part lab notebook, part personal sandbox.

## Credentials, Experience, and Other Justifications for Listening to Me

- **Masters in Finance & Risk Management**  - expert in ratios, reporting, valuation, and allocation.
- **Masters in Economics & Econometrics**  -  causality, statistical proofs, assumption challenging, spirited critique.
- **"Investment Analyst" at a Fortune 200 company**  
    - *Misleading title — it's really half finance, half data science, with a marketing flavor*  
- **Statistical researcher and consultant**, helping others wrangle their data and math into publishable form
- **Recovering systems administrator** (yes, I still consider replacing Windows with Arch every 6 months)

## What I Actually Do

My work lives at the intersection of **data science, finance, and strategy**, where I use quantitative and computational methods to find structure in messy, intricate datasets.
I'm currently in process with pulling some fancy new AI tools like vector databases, retrieval augmentation, and unsupervised learning into the fold.

I specialize in:
- **Causal inference**  
- **Machine learning** (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Symbolic Regression, etc.)  
- **Bayesian and frequentist statistical modeling**  
- **Measuring real-world impact, from media to markets**  
- Telling compelling stories from complex models

In short: I like solving hard problems with data, and I try to stay on the steep part of the learning curve. Lately I’ve been reading [*Bayesian Data Analysis*](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/book/) — it’s as good as everyone says.
