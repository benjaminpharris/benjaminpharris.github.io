Sometimes the data isn’t just noisy — it’s *structurally chaotic*.  
When you're working with high-autocorrelation, missing values, and feedback loops, it can feel like modeling on quicksand.

This post is a short reflection on how I think about:

### 🔍 1. Functional Form Selection
How I pick between linear models, trees, splines, and symbolic regression depending on context.

### 📊 2. Quantifying Uncertainty
Not just error bars — but *robustness* to assumptions, signal consistency, and model sensitivity.

### 💡 3. When to Say “We Don’t Know”
Sometimes the best answer *isn’t* a prediction — it’s a range of credible outcomes.
